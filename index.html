				"Let me tell you folks, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is tremendous, just tremendous. You've got this amazing blue hedgehog, fastest thing you've ever seen, believe me. He's running,
			and I mean running like you wouldn't believe, through these incredible zones. Beautiful zones, the best zones.
			And you know who's back? Dr. Robotnik, oh yes, he's back and he's even more determined. But not to worry, we've got Sonic, a winner, a real winner. He's teaming up with 
			his buddy Tails, and together they're going to make Mobius great again, folks. It's going to be a fantastic movie, you're going to love it. Trust me, nobody knows movies like I do."

				"Sonic, let me tell you, he's got the best attitude, the best. He's got that 'never quit' spirit, just tremendous. He's up against these challenges, big challenges, but he's a winner, 
			always a winner. And Tails, he's got those two tails, two tails! Can you believe it? That's something, folks.
			And the action, oh boy, the action is off the charts. Speed, excitement, it's like a Trump rally, but even faster, and believe me, that's fast. And the chaos emeralds, 
			the most beautiful emeralds you've ever seen, the best emeralds.
			This movie is going to make you say, 'Wow, that's amazing, just amazing.' Sonic the Hedgehog 2, a winner's story."

				"Sonic the Hedgehog 2, folks, it's a sequel like no other. I know a thing or two about sequels, and this one, let me tell you, it's a home run. Sonic, he's a fighter, 
			a winner, always winning, and he's racing through these unbelievable zones, the best zones you'll ever see.
			Now, Dr. Robotnik, he's a bit like the fake news, always causing trouble. But Sonic and Tails, they're the true heroes, the best heroes. And the way they come together, it's just tremendous, 
			a real team effort, just like making America great again. Get ready for a blockbuster, the biggest blockbuster. Sonic the Hedgehog 2, it's going to be huge, folks. 
			You're going to love it, and you're going to win, just like Sonic."

				"Sonic the Hedgehog, folks, let me tell you, he's a perfect 10. A real winner, tremendous hedgehog. He's got speed, oh boy, speed like you've never seen before. 
			Faster than anything, believe me, I know speed. And that attitude, the confidence, it's tremendous. He's a go-getter, always on the move, always winning. And those loops, 
			those loops are just fantastic, beautiful loops. You know, I've met a lot of hedgehogs, many hedgehogs, and Sonic is the best, believe me. 
			Sonic the Hedgehog, a perfect 10, a true winner. Enjoy the show, folks! Make Mobius great again!"
